<-s>: This program covered a lot of new content for me and it was interesting trying to assign the
the variables and write all of the equations to give out the correct answers in response. I also str
struggled trying to get the money spent, the us dollar equivalent, and the us dollars remaining to be 
in the same row and be directly underneath one another with the correct amount of spaces for each 
line of code.
<+s>: A positive aspect of this code specifically was that I was able to work off of what I had done 
right and repeat that in order to have everything come together. In other words, once I got an
understanding of how to do the mexican pesos dollars remaining and the formulas/variables, everything
came to me and I was able to use the right things to finish the rest of the program.

In the future: I will definitely continue to pay attention to the content we are learning and make sure that 
I have a good understanding of the material before moving forward to ensure that I make fewer mistakes because
I tend to be a perfectionist and when I make mistakes it prolongs my process.
